Let $S=S(t)$ be a risk factor that, for simplicity, we call a stock. Let us
assume its annualized volatility is $\sigma $. Consider $N+1$ primer
brokers. We consider the situation from the point of view of broker $0.$ Let
us assume that a client (hedge fund, or HF) has a position in $S$ against
broker $0$. We denote the position that the PB $0$ has against HF as $P_{0}.$
